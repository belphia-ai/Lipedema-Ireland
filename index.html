      <h2>What is lipedema?</h2>
      <p>Lipedema is a chronic, progressive condition characterised by abnormal, symmetrical accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue, primarily affecting the hips, buttocks and legs, often sparing the feet. It primarily affects women and may cause pain, tenderness, and easy bruising.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Stages & symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage I:</strong> Smooth skin surface, enlarged subcutaneous tissue with normal skin texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Stage II:</strong> Skin becomes uneven, nodules and fat lobules appear; cellulite-like changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> Large deforming masses of fatty tissue; skin surface quite irregular.</li>
        <li><strong>Early symptoms:</strong> Pain, tenderness, easy bruising, disproportionate lower-body fat, reduced mobility.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>Diagnosis is primarily clinical: history and physical exam, often by a specialist (lymphologist, vascular surgeon, dermatologist, or specialist physiotherapist). Typical approach includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical history and progression pattern (often starts at puberty or hormonal events).</li>
        <li>Clinical exam: symmetrical distribution, pain, sparing of feet.</li>
        <li>Imaging (ultrasound, MRI, lymphoscintigraphy) to rule out other causes and assess tissue; doppler ultrasound to exclude venous disease.</li>
        <li>Ruling out lymphedema and obesity—both can coexist.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Treatments & management</h2>
      <p>While there's no cure for lipedema, evidence-based management reduces symptoms and improves function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conservative therapy:</strong> compression garments, manual lymphatic drainage (specialised physiotherapy), skin care, exercise, weight management support for general health.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication:</strong> limited role; manage pain and comorbidities.</li>
        <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> liposuction (especially tumescent or water-assisted liposuction) by surgeons experienced in lipedema can improve contour, reduce pain and improve mobility.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Accessing care in Ireland</h2>
      <p>Pathways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with your GP: document symptoms and request referral to appropriate specialist (vascular surgeon, lymphology clinic, or plastic surgeon with lipedema experience).</li>
        <li>Specialist assessment: clinics in major centres (Dublin, Cork, Galway) may offer comprehensive assessment and conservative therapies.</li>
        <li>Physiotherapy: seek therapists trained in lymphoedema/lipedema management.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Funding surgery & private options</h2>
      <p>In Ireland, funding for liposuction for lipedema via public healthcare is limited and typically assessed case-by-case. Practical steps to seek funding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtain thorough specialist reports documenting functional impairment despite conservative care.</li>
        <li>Ask specialist about clinical codes and whether the procedure is considered clinically necessary (medical not cosmetic).</li>
        <li>Apply for HSE funding pathways or exceptional funding—prepare a folder with clinical notes, photos, specialist letters, and evidence of failed conservative management.</li>
        <li>Private surgery: many patients choose experienced private surgeons; compare surgeons’ experience with lipedema-specific techniques and outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Support & resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.lipedema.org">Lipedema Foundation (international)</a></li>
        <li>Local support groups: consider searching Facebook groups and Irish patient networks for peer support.</li>
        <li>Patient advocates and charities may help with appeals and funding applications.</li>
      </ul>
